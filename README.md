# Code Base for Sadrach Square

This repo contains code for GameShrine, Simple Grocery list app, and my portfolio website

GameShrine is a website where I write articles about gaming trends that I find interesting. I also have
have a list of upcoming video games that on the front page. All the articles and images are stored use AWS's
dynamodb. I have been using graphql to make queries and mutations to the database. I also have an admin page that
helps me create, update, or delete any article at any time. I store images using s3 buckets. Most of the code is 
written using React.
